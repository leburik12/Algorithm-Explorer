# Algorithm-Explorer
Algorithm Explorer is an Android application that provides a basic introduction to various algorithms in different areas of computer science such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Structures, and Computer Vision. The app uses a RecyclerView to display a list of algorithms, each leading to a detailed page with a simple code review for better understanding.

Features
Display a list of algorithms categorized by computer science areas.
Provide detailed information and simple code reviews for each algorithm.
Utilize RecyclerView for efficient list display and navigation.
Built using Kotlin.

Code Review Highlights

RecyclerView Usage: Efficiently displays a list of algorithms with item click listeners.
Kotlin Coroutines: (Optional) For asynchronous tasks like fetching data from a remote source.
Dependency Injection: (Optional) For managing dependencies and improving code testability.
Clean Architecture: (Optional) For structuring the app into layers (presentation, domain, data) for better maintainability.
